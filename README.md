#Odot: Todo list built with Ruby on Rails
This todo list was built using Ruby on Rails based on the tutorial by [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/).

This tutorial was used to learn the basics of the Rails framework and Test Driven Development(TDD) utilizing Rspec and Capybara. I will be adding to it as I continue to learn.
Built with Ruby 2.2 and Rails 4.2.
